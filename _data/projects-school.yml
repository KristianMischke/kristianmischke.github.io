  responsibilities:
    - description: <i>Computer Graphics</i> (Spring 2020) Implemented <span class="tool-secondary">ray-tracing</span> algorithm in <span class="tool-primary">C++</span>. Used shaders and GLEW and GLSL to push vertices to the render pipeline. We used <span class="tool-primary">Git</span> version control to track progress.
    - description: <i>Intro to NLP</i> (Fall 2020). Implemented–with a group of 3 others–a <span class="tool-secondary">Grammar Induction</span> algorithm in <span class="tool-primary">Python</span> from an academic paper that uses a cascaded chunking algorithm with <span class="tool-secondary">HMMs</span>. We applied it to Trading Card Games like <i>Magic the Gathering</i>. Other assignments included creating a <span class="tool-secondary">Naïve Bayes N-Gram classifier</span> in <span class="tool-primary">Java</span>, and <span class="tool-secondary">PMI</span> calculations in <span class="tool-primary">Python</span> (languages by choice).
    - description: <i>Graphics for Games</i> (Fall 2020). Gained more experience navigating a large codebase, namely the <span class="tool-primary">Unreal Engine C++</span> source. Projects focused on implementing graphics algorithms as Blueprints, Plugins, and Engine modifications.

   <p>Scratch is a drag and drop programming language developed by MIT.</p>
   <p>Throughout the year, the students learned how to make creative interactive projects, including:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>An expression of what super power they would like to have</li>
      <li>A main menu for for a potential game</li>
      <li>Each of the students chose to create either Snake, War or Uno</li>
      <li>And their final projects are displayed further down on this page</li>
   </ul>

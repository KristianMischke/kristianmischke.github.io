description: "I was exploring the creation of the well-known game, minecraft! This is my own game which is similar to it, but will be sci-fi related and will have a bunch of awesomeness! I still need to come up with a name for it, but I think I will wait until later for that. let's just call it \"Mineocrafte\" for now (min - ee - oh - cr - ah - ft -ey)."

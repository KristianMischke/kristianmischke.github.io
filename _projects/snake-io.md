title:  "Snake.io"
subtitle: "(Multiplayer Scratch Project)"
description: "Based on the original Snake game as well as the infamous slither.io. This project is made on MIT's drag-n-drop programming software called Scratch. This is my first successful multiplayer game where all the networking was coded by myself. This was a very fun project to work on."

   <h1>Welcome to the MS Scratch and HS Programming Final Projects</h1>
   <h4 style="color:grey">Crossroads Homeschool Co-Op {{page.school-year}}</h4>

   <p>The Middle School class used the program called Scratch, which is a drag and drop programming language developed by MIT.</p>
   <p>This year, the students used an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC44hbuzQZteAb82_8QzfBvw" target="_blank">online video resource</a> created by Kristian Mischke to fascilitate individualized learning. Throughout the year, the students learned how to make creative interactive projects, including:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>An interactive project that shared about their interests</li>
      <li>A basic game with a main menu</li>
      <li>Other small challenges</li>
      <li>And their final projects are displayed further down on this page</li>
   </ul>

   <br/>
   </br>
   <p>The Highschool class learned a programming environment called <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> which built on the Java programming language</p>

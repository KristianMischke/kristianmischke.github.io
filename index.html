      <h1>Kristian Mischke</h1>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Diligent student with over three years of experience in the industry. Enthusiastic about education and has enjoyed teaching programming basics to middle- and high-schoolers for the past 5 years. My degree focuses on Game Development and I have worked in the industry as a Junior Programmer for a couple years now and have worked on multiple game-jams and hobby projects. I am looking to eventually pursue a masterâ€™s degree in Computational Linguistics and build a career focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Human Computer Interfaces (HCI). I love learning languages and have achieved intermediate German fluency and want to bring that fluency higher and pursue other languages like Russian, ancient Greek, and a middle eastern language.</p>

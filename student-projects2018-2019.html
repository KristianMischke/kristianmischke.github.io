   <p>Scratch is a drag and drop programming language developed by MIT.</p>
   <p>This year, the students used an <a href="https://www.dragndropcoding.com/" target="_blank">online video resource</a> created by Kristian Mischke to fascilitate individualized learning. Throughout the year, the students learned how to make creative interactive projects, including:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>An interactive project that shared about their interests</li>
      <li>A basic game with a main menu</li>
      <li>Other small challenges</li>
      <li>And their final projects are displayed further down on this page</li>
   </ul>

   <p>If you want to see their previous work, you can go <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/5506576/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

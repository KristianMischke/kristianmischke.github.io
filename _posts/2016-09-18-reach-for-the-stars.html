There's not enough time! We all have a thousand things to do, this then that, then this and that again. Busy, busy, busy. We chase after the fireflies of this world, but we could be spending our time reaching for the stars!The celestial bodies are truly an amazing illustration of God's creativity and imagination. Just take a night and look at the sky. Drive out into the country, and open your eyes ten times as much. Find the constellations and gaze upon the beauty of the vast expanses.

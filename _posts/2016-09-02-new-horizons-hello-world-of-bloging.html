title: New Horizons - Hello World of Bloging
tag: 
---



In Computer Programming, the first script a beginner usually writes is a simple display of the text "Hello World!" I know that sounds *so exciting* but everyone has got to start somewhere. That being said: hello world of blogging! A new journey has just begun, and you can follow along with it. Some of you will follow from the beginning, and others will happen upon this post sometime in the future. No matter what, you're most-likely reading these words on some sort of glowing, rectangular device.<img src="http://static.wixstatic.com/media/eec9b8_9dccff97d47645a6b73219e53da74059%7Emv2_d_5152_3864_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_208%2Ch_156/eec9b8_9dccff97d47645a6b73219e53da74059%7Emv2_d_5152_3864_s_4_2.jpg"/>

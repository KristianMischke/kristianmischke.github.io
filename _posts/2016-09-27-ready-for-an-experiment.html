Anyone out there trying to learn a new language, but you're stuck because you don't know the alphabet? Well, I believe I've come up with a method that will truncate the learning time, so you can spend more time on the language and not the alphabet.(Greek uppercase sigma Σ = S as in Soft)I have created a Google Form, which you can acceΣ here. If you'd like to contribute to my experiment, it would mean Σo much to me! The experiment is Σimply to test out Σome factors to Σee how well they work in<img src="http://static.wixstatic.com/media/eec9b8_6ef69a840a924f21893d6dbc4866463c%7Emv2.png"/>
